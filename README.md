## Hey all ✌🏽

My name's Andrico and I'm a Frontend Developer at HealthHero. I'm currently obsessed with accessibility, web components and design systems.

I'm trying my hand combining all three with [oui-ui](https://github.com/andrico1234/oui-ui). And for those who don't speak French, Yui will translate that for you:

<div align="center">
<img src="https://public-images-and-stuff.s3.amazonaws.com/yui-speech.png" alt="Yui, the oui-ui mascot, saying 'Yes, UI'" align="center" width="300" />
</div>

<br />

I've contributed to a small handful of OSS projects like [React Admin](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin), and you can find other bits, bobs, and a bunch of easter eggs, at [andri.co](https://andri.co).

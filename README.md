## Hey all ✌🏽

My name's Andrico and I'm a Frontend Developer based in London. I'm currently obsessed with accessibility, web components and design systems.

I'm also the creator of [Component Odyssey](https://component-odyssey.com/)

<br />

I've also contributed to a small handful of OSS projects like [a2k](https://a2000.netlify.app/), [React Admin](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin), and you can find other bits, bobs, and a bunch of easter eggs, at [andri.co](https://andri.co).

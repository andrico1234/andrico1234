## Hey all ‚úåüèΩ

My name's Andrico and I'm a Frontend Developer at Anima. I'm currently obsessed with accessibility, web components and design systems.

I'm trying my hand combining all three with [a2k](https://a2000.netlify.app/).

<br />

I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andricokaroulla) and [Polywork](https://www.polywork.com/andrico1234#). I've also contributed to a small handful of OSS projects like [React Admin](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin), and you can find other bits, bobs, and a bunch of easter eggs, at [andri.co](https://andri.co).

## Hey all ‚úåüèΩ

My name's Andrico and I'm a Frontend Developer at HealthHero. I'm currently obsessed with accessibility, web components and design systems.

I'm trying my hand combining all three with [oui-ui](https://github.com/andrico1234/oui-ui). And for those who don't speak French, let Yui translate that for you:

[Yui, the oui-ui mascot, saying "Yes, UI"](https://public-images-and-stuff.s3.amazonaws.com/yui-speech.png).

I've contributed to small handful of OSS projects like [React Admin](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin), and you can find other bits, bobs, and a bunch of easter eggs, on [andri.co](https://andri.co).
